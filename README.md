# Exam-Seating-Arrangement-System
**I had created this project as my Software Engineering Project in 6th Semester.**
<br/>
<br/>
During exam period it is very hectic task to find out where is your examination hall and which seat would allocate 
to a perticular student.This is a web application developed to help students to find out their respective examination hall during semester exam.
This would also shows the respective seat of a student in a perticular row and also the schedule of their examination.

It is an application in which you can search your roll number to find out your examination classroom.If you want to know about your complete class then this facility is also available you just have to search your class , year and branch.
You can also enter examination hall number to see which class is allocated to which class.

This one is develop using HTML , bootstrap and LAMP(Linux ,Apache ,MySQL , PHP).

Some changes could be done here to make it more reliable and more automatic like sending a message to students about their examination hall and timetable etc.

Requirements to run this are : LAMP/XAMPP/WAMP ,PhpMyAdmin
<br/>
 Restart apache2 using-
```sudo service apache2 restart
```
